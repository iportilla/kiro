Here is a **short, junior-developer-friendly README** that explains **how to install and use Kiro** for the Airbnb sentiment analysis assignment.

It assumes no prior experience and gives step-by-step instructions.

# **🏠 Airbnb Sentiment Analyzer — Quick Start Guide (For Junior Developers)**





This project teaches you how to use **Kiro** + **OpenAI** to analyze sentiment in Airbnb reviews.

You’ll convert a Jupyter notebook into a simple **Streamlit app**.



This guide walks you through **installing Kiro**, **setting up your environment**, and **running the app**.



------





## **✅ 1. Install Requirements**





Make sure you have **Python 3.9+** installed.



Then install the dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you need to install Kiro separately:

```
pip install kiro
```



------





## **✅ 2. Set Your API Keys**





You will need:



- **OpenAI API Key**
- **Kiro API Key**





You can pass them in the Streamlit UI, or store them in a .env file:



Create .env:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
KIRO_API_KEY=your_kiro_key_here
```



------





## **✅ 3. Run the Streamlit App**





Start the app with:

```
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

This will open your browser at:

```
http://localhost:8501
```



------





## **✅ 4. How the App Works**





The Streamlit app will let you:





### **➤ Paste a single Airbnb review**





OR





### **➤ Upload a CSV file with a** 

### **review**

###  **column**





Then the app will:



1. Call your Kiro + OpenAI sentiment pipeline

2. Return:

   

   - Sentiment (“positive” / “negative” / “neutral”)
   - Confidence score
   - Explanation generated by the model

   





------





## **✅ 5. Where Your Code Goes**





Inside your repo, you’ll add your logic here:

```
sentiment/
 └── pipeline.py     # your Kiro + OpenAI refactored code
```

In streamlit_app.py, you’ll see a placeholder:

```
# result = run_sentiment_pipeline(review_text)
```

Replace that with your real function.



------





## **✅ 6. Troubleshooting**







### **❌** 

### **Error: No API key found**





Make sure your .env is loaded or paste keys into the sidebar.





### **❌** 

### **Kiro module not found**





Install it:

```
pip install kiro
```



### **❌** 

### **Streamlit not running**





Make sure you’re in the correct folder:

```
cd airbnb-sentiment-app
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```



------





## **🎯 Final Notes for the Assignment**





- Keep the app simple
- Make sure your Kiro pipeline works for both single reviews and CSV files
- Include screenshots in your final submission
- Update your README with instructions for running your version
