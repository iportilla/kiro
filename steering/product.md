# Product Overview

This project demonstrates sentiment analysis using IBM Watson AI services. It contains two main use cases:

1. **Legal Document Sentiment Analysis** - Uses IBM watsonx.ai with the Mixtral-8x7b-instruct model to analyze sentiment in legal phrases and court documents
2. **Review Sentiment Analysis** - Deploys pretrained Watson NLP models as Python functions to analyze sentiment in customer reviews from various cities

The project showcases how to leverage IBM's AI/ML platform for natural language processing tasks, specifically sentiment classification (positive, neutral, negative).
